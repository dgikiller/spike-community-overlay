<b> Sabyon stock kernel is quite fine for most users </b>

<p> However a Spike edtion could be needed, secoundly 
<blockquote>I'm sick of mylatop being in a fucked up state over 
ISCSI </blockquote>
the package that applies the kernel modeule is dated hsnt been updated to build km's
<cite>sys-block/iscsitarget 3.6 linux last. </cite>, 
and every update sabayon makes breaks the kernel at boot, and infinite loop becuase systemD will force the service to loand and not give up. 
<p> in time more security patches or sabayon-spike-Tinfoil (ie an especially GRSEC patched) 
and wifi from wireless comapt pentesting. 

I dont claim to be a kernel Foo expert, but least i'll give anything a shot. 
for now works in progress.
