	<longdescription lang="en">Tests which standard Linux kernel and PaX security features are in use
	Modern Linux distributions offer some mitigation techniques to make it harder to exploit software vulnerabilities reliably. 
	Mitigations such as RELRO, NoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, 
	Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Position Independent Executables (PIE) have made reliably exploiting any vulnerabilities that do exist far more challenging. 
	The checksec.sh script is designed to test what standard Linux OS and PaX security features are being used.</longdescription>
